# Ensemble

Ensemble is a set of [samples](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) for JavaFX 2. Unfortunately, it is only available as a NetBeans project, and through an Ant build.

This project is a port of Ensemble to Maven so that IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse users can also play with JavaFX.
