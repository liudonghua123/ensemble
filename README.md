# Ensemble

Ensemble is a set of [samples](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) for JavaFX 2. Unfortunately, it is only available as a NetBeans project, and through an Ant build.

This project is a port of Ensemble to Maven so that IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse users can also play with JavaFX.

# Native Build with Excelsior JET

You may build the sample as a native application for all major desktop platforms (Windows, OS X, Linux) using
[Excelsior JET Maven Plugin](https://github.com/excelsior-oss/excelsior-jet-maven-plugin) with the command:
```bash
mvn jet:build
```
